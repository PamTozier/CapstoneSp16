# CapstoneSp16
Hold Source Code for the Spring 2016 Capstone Project Site

Initial Steps
Create a Branch of the site which will hold your changes. Use your name so there is no confusion.

Download the Github Desktop client

Clone your branch in the desktop location, make your file changes locally. Commit early and often. 


Once you get to a stopping point, do a final commit for the day and name it based on the updates you made, this is a best practice for keeping track of where you are.
Sync (upper right corner) the commit to Git Hub, your new code will be saved in your branch for future use and you can get there anywhere.

Once your part is complete, click pull request so we can all review and merge the changes back into the master.

the Master code will be the final project once all parts have been merged, the final project can be submitted for a grade.
