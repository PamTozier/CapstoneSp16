# CapstoneSp16
Hold Source Code for the Spring 2016 Capstone Project Site

<h2>Initial Steps</h2>
Create a Branch of the site which will hold your changes. Use your name so there is no confusion.
<br/>
Download the Github Desktop client
<br/>
Clone your branch in the desktop location, make your file changes locally. Commit early and often. 

<br/>
Once you get to a stopping point, do a final commit for the day and name it based on the updates you made, this is a best practice for keeping track of where you are.<br/>

<h2>Sync</h2> (upper right corner) the commit to Git Hub, your new code will be saved in your branch for future use and you can get there anywhere.
<br/>
Once your part is complete, click pull request so we can all review and merge the changes back into the master.
<br/>
the Master code will be the final project once all parts have been merged, the final project can be submitted for a grade.
